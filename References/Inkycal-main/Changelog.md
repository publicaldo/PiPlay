### Fixed
* Fixed problems with iCalendar triggers by removing them altogether when parsing the iCalendar

(*) Updating too frequently can cause ghosting, a problem specific to E-Paper displays where parts of the previous image can be seen on the current image. Ghosting can be fixed by 'calibrating' the E-Paper (displaying a single colour on the entire display) and is done by default. As a rule of thumb, one 'calibration' should be done for every 6 display-updates to maintain a crisp image.
